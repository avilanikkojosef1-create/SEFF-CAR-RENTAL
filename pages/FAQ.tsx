      question: "2. Is there a security deposit?",

    },
    {
      question: "3. What is your fuel policy?",
      answer: "We follow a \"Full-to-Full\" policy. The vehicle will be released to you with a full tank, and it must be returned with a full tank. If returned with less fuel, a refueling fee will apply."
    },
    {
      question: "4. What is your Cancellation Policy?",
      answer: "The reservation fee is non-refundable unless the cancellation is due to extreme weather, documented health emergencies, or proven flight cancellations. Cancellations for other reasons made less than 24 hours before your schedule will forfeit the fee."
    },
    {
      question: "5. Can I reschedule my booking?",
      answer: "Yes, as long as a vehicle is available for your new dates. Please contact us at 0921 421 4729 as soon as possible to request a change."

    },
    {
      question: "7. Are there mileage limits?",

    },
    {
      question: "8. What happens if I have an accident or the car breaks down?",
      answer: "Your safety is our priority. In case of an emergency, contact our 24/7 support line immediately at 0921 421 4729. Do not attempt to repair the vehicle yourself or negotiate a private settlement with third parties without informing us first."
    },
    {
      question: "9. Can I bring pets or smoke inside the car?",
      answer: "To keep our fleet fresh for all clients, smoking is strictly prohibited inside the vehicle. Small pets are allowed but must be in a carrier; otherwise, a professional cleaning fee may apply upon return."
